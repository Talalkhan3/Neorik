          37% of e-commerce sales happened on a mobile device in 2013, and this
          year we expect to see this jump to more than 50%. <br /> 72% of tablet owners
          make purchases from their devices on a weekly basis. <br /> 88% of people
          agree that having a mobile device with real time information makes
          them more spontaneous with shopping. <br /> 30% of mobile shoppers abandon a
          transaction if the experience is not optimized for mobile. <br /> For us,
          e-commerce and m-commerce go hand in hand – we use responsive web
          design to create online storefronts that look just as good on phones
          and tablets as they do on a desktop. <br /> For 2014 and beyond, running a
          successful online store means making the most of mobile. With a
          responsive m-commerce site from Nine Sixty, you can do exactly that.
