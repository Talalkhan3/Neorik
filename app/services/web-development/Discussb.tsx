        We build mobile-friendly websites using the latest responsive design
        techniques. Our websites work seamlessly across desktops, tablets and
        smartphones in order to provide the best possible user experience on
        every device. Using responsive design, we build websites with flexible
        layouts that shift according to the size and shape of the screen or
        browser they’re viewed on. <br /> <br /> To make the most of mobile
        traffic now, and ensure that your site is as future-proof as possible,
        there’s no better option. Responsive design is also recommended by
        Google – it’s the best way to optimize your site for mobile without
        damaging your SEO. With a responsive site, there are no duplicate
        content problems, as users access the same URLs on any device. If your
        website doesn’t provide a good user experience on mobile, Google may
        choose not to show your site to users performing searches on the move,
        which means that you could end up missing out on 30% or more of
        potential visits. <br /> <br /> With a responsive website, you can
        maximize your chances of being found online, and make the most of your
        traffic when it arrives.
