        In 2014, optimising your website for mobile is a must. Nearly 30% of all
        internet traffic is now mobile, and that figure is increasing fast.
        People use mobile devices at home, at work and on the move. They
        research, compare, enquire, book and buy on mobiles. They are engaged,
        valuable visitors who you simply canâ€™t ignore. If your website is hard
        to view and difficult to use on a smaller screen, you risk alienating
        users and losing out on sales or enquiries. 85% of adults think your
        mobile website should be as good as or better than your desktop site,
        and a responsive website can quadruple your conversions on mobile.
