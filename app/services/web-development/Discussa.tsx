        In 2024, optimising your website for mobile is a must. Nearly 30% of all
        internet traffic is now mobile, and that figure is increasing fast.
        People use mobile devices at home, at work and on the move. <br /> <br /> They
        research, compare, enquire, book and buy on mobiles. They are engaged,
        valuable visitors who you simply canâ€™t ignore. If your website is hard
        to view and difficult to use on a smaller screen, you risk alienating
        users and losing out on sales or enquiries. <br /> <br /> 85% of adults think your
        mobile website should be as good as or better than your desktop site,
        and a responsive website can quadruple your conversions on mobile.
